Tasty spaghetti for a multiplayer 2d sandbox game that died due to flash player's end.

The amount of work I've put in this was a lot compared to my other projects, but I abandoned it because I was losing interest due to the following reasons:
- No one would actually play such a clone of a dead game
- Functional clones already exist- guess what, they have 0 active players (The original flash game was always active with around 50-100 players iirc)
- The code was a bit rushed, leading to spaghetti design.
- Java is really NOT the language you want for a game. Trust me, just go with C++, C#, or even JS if you want web.
- Networking is kinda buggy though if the other reasons didn't exist, I'd have fixed it lol (I highly recommend using "Clumsy" program to simulate lag and stuff)
